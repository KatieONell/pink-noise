Code notebooks for the paper "Complex mutual adaptation in dyads’ semantic similarity trajectories predicts conversation success"
* `figures-and-statistics.ipynb` produces all data figures and statistical tests from the paper
* `quickstart-and-tutorial.ipynb`  provides code for calculating pink noise robustness scores (our measure of complex mutual adapatation) and a step-by-step explainer of how the measure is derived

In both notebooks, the data will be automatically fetched from OSF, but if you'd like to see the original audio files and transcripts, check out the project here: https://osf.io/7ju2s <br><br>

Fig. 1. Methods overview.  (A) An artificial conversation snippet. (B) A depiction of how a semantic similarity trajectory is generated for a single conversation transcript. Top: each point represents the one-dimensional projection of a 768-dimensional semantic embedding of a conversational turn: see the expanded box for an example. The red and blue lines represent each of the two speakers’ separate trajectories through semantic space, and the gradient lines connecting each adjacent turn represent the (cosine) distance between these turns’ embeddings. Bottom: a depiction of the whole conversation’s semantic similarity trajectory. Note that the yellow bars connecting points on this trajectory to the maximum value of 1 are the same length as the yellow bars in the top of this figure, which represent semantic distance between embeddings of adjacent turns. (C) A depiction of how a semantic similarity trajectory’s pink noise robustness (PNR) is calculated. Left top: the example semantic similarity trajectory from B, which has a noise scaling coefficient of 0.71. Left bottom: an example similarity trajectory generated by shuffling the signal in the panel above. A null distribution of noise scaling coefficients is built for each conversation by repeating this shuffling process 1,000 times and calculating a noise scaling coefficient for each of these shuffled trajectories. Right: a depiction of a conversation’s original noise scaling coefficient as compared to its null distribution. A conversation’s pink noise robustness (PNR) is calculated as 1 - the proportion of shuffled trajectory noise coefficients that are pinker than the original.
